lsapi - LSAPI extension for Ruby
================================

INSTALL
-------

  $ ruby setup.rb config
  $ ruby setup.rb setup
  # ruby setup.rb install

USAGE
-----

General CGI scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The most efficient way to use LSAPI interface is to modify your CGI scripts. 
You need to add the following code to your CGI scripts:

  require 'lsapi'
  
  while LSAPI.accept != nil

     <your CGI script>
     ...

  end

There is no need to change the way that how CGI environment variables 
are being accessed in your scripts.

You can find some examples under examples/ folder.


Ruby Script Runner
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you don't want to change your existing Ruby CGI code, you can use our 
Ruby script runner under scripts/ folder. You need to configure 
lsruby_runner.rb as a LSAPI application, then add a script handler 
for "rb" suffix.



Rack/Rails Runner
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With Ruby LSAPI, we proudly provide a optimum platform for Rack/Rails 
application deployment. Ruby LSAPI has the following advantages over 
other solutions.

  * Easy configuration, deploy a Rails application only take a few clicks
    with our Rails easy configuration
  * Fast startup, the expensive Rails framework initialization only takes
    place once when multiple processes need to be started
  * Resource efficience, ruby processes can be started on demand, idle
    process will be stop.
  * ruby-lsapi 4.1 release added native support for RewindableInput interface
    required by RACK middleware, delivering superior performance than all 
    other Rack handler implementations.
  * Rack LSWS handler in LSWS 4.2.2 release also support Sendfile middleware
    intercepts to take advantage of LiteSpeed web serverâ€™s optimized file 
    delivery code.
